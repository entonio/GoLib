GoLib
=====

This is a collection of code that I've developed over the years to help in writing my own go programs, and hence the imaginative name.

I publish it here in case someone may find parts of it useful. It would be strange indeed if someone had use for all of it.

This is a single library containing several packages, rather than being a set of independent packages, because many of them are dependent on others, chiefly but not only the `lang` package.

This is not written in the usual go style, it's written the way I like it to be. If you wish to use parts of it in your own work, you should probably adjust it to your target standards.

There is little to no documentation. Parts of the code are older than others, and partly due to the language's evolution itself, I would probably write them differently today, or not at all. Still, there has been some effort in keeping the whole up to date with APIs and language features.
